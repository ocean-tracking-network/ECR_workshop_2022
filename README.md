# ERC_workshop_2022
actel example for the OTN symposium 2022 data management workshop

This repository contains an example dataset for actel. It is intended to be run using the residency() function. The dataset contains intentional mistakes that will trigger actel's failsafes.

This is the code you need to run this example:

```r
library('actel')

x <- residency(tz = "Europe/Copenhagen", report = TRUE)
b
y
b
y
```
